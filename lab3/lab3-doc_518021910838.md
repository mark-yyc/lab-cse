# description about my code

## part1 NONE
1. hash function:  
I use SDBMHash to map the byte sequence into an integer, to make integer in the range of 2~1023, I make some adjustments on the SDBHash, which can be seen in ydb_server.cc  
2. After that, the job is just to call function in the extent server

## part2 2PL
### part2A
1. I use map to cache read and write of one transaction, the inner map records changes in each entries
```
map<ydb_protocol::transaction_id,std::map<extent_protocol::extentid_t,std::string> > transaction_group
```
if the transaction is committed, the content of the entries' map will be writen into file system using extent server, if the transaction aborts, the entry will just be remove from the map  

2. read and write in the same transaction, if the map does not has an entry about the extentid, it will make fucntion call for extent server, if the map has the entry, read and write will directly work on the entry

3. 
```
lc->acquire(0);
lc->acquire(1);
```
code above act as pthread_mutex to make get/set/del/begin/abort/commit atomic

### part2B
1. check deadlock
use direct map: if there is no cycle on the transaction_id, there will be no deadlock;  
the structure of map:
```
std::map<ydb_protocol::transaction_id,ydb_protocol::transaction_id> node_group;
```
the first parameter for the map: transaction_id
+ id<0: transaction
+ id>0: extentid(lock_id)

the second parameter for the map:
+ id<0(transaction): the extentid(lock_id) the transaction is acquiring(has not acuqired)
+ id>0(lock): the lock is used by which transaction_id

2. before lc->acquire(extentid) and lc->release(extentid), the node_group above will be modified.  
before lc->acquire(extentid) the function check_cycle will be called to examine the cycle. If true, the transaction will be abort;

## part3 OCC
1. like part2A the same structure is being used:
```
std::map<ydb_protocol::transaction_id,std::map<extent_protocol::extentid_t,std::string> > read_set;
std::map<ydb_protocol::transaction_id,std::map<extent_protocol::extentid_t,std::string> > write_set;
```

2. read and write will directly work on the two set, when commiting, if the read_set is different from the data read from file_system, the transaction will be aborted
